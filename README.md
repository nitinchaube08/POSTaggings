# POS Tagging Grammar Checker

An interactive web application for grammar checking using POS tagging. This application implements three methods: rule-based tagging, statistical methods (HMM, CRF), and neural networks (e.g., transformers). Users can compare model performance and accuracy directly on the web interface.

## Project Features
- **Grammar Checking** using:
  1. Rule-Based Tagging
  2. Statistical Methods (HMM, CRF)
  3. Neural Networks (Transformer-based models)
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compare model accuracy, precision, recall, and runtime.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly design built with React and Material-UI.
- **Backend**: Powered by Flask/FastAPI for processing requests.
